# Regression_TheranHousing
Housing data generated from [Tehran Divar](https://divar.ir/s/tehran/) website will be analyzed in this notebook. I use different types of regression for evaluating model and compare the results of those types. 
Predicting housing price in Tehran and also choosing a good regression algorithm is the goal of this notebook.

This dataset is available in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/amiralimadadi/tehran-housing) and you can also check the scrap project for generating this dataset [here](https://github.com/amiralimadadi/Divar_WebScrap).

## Prerequisites
I use some famous python libraries like *numpy*, *pandas*, *sklearn* and *seaborn*. In order to do some specific activies, I have to use *unidecode,bidi.algorithm and arabic_reshaper*.

**Tip** The instructio of *!pip install ...* is written in the notebook to ensure that all libraries are installed in the destination machine.

## Files
1.   **Analysis.ipynb**: Contains the entire python code of project. Data analysis, regression result and choose the best model is included in the file.
2.   **Data.csv**: It is the dataset of housing in Tehran and is the input of this project. It is available in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/amiralimadadi/tehran-housing) too.
